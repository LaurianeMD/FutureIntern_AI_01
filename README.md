# Text Generation with Fine-tuned GPT-2 on Homer's Odyssey

This project uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model trained on the poem **"The Odyssey" by Homer**. The model generates text inspired by the themes, style, and structure of this epic poem. The interactive interface, powered by **Gradio**, allows users to experiment with prompts and witness the poetic outputs of the fine-tuned GPT-2 model.

## Features
- Generate poetic text based on prompts inspired by "The Odyssey."
- Adjust the maximum length of the generated text and the number of outputs.
- Simple and intuitive Gradio interface for experimentation.

## Dataset
The model is fine-tuned on the text of **Homer's Odyssey**, ensuring that the outputs reflect the epic poem's themes and narrative style.

## Try It Out on Google Colab
You can explore and test the model using this **Google Colab** notebook:
